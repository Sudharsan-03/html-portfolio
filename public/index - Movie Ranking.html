<p>My third most favourite movie in my list. Emotional and more and more actions. The movie was based on a real story. The story taken from the 19th centuary of India, where british ruled India at that time. This movie shows how Indians fought against british and killed them. Eberything shown in the movie was not a real story. I'ts a bit different from the real story.</p>
